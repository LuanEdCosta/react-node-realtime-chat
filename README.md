# :speech_balloon: Realtime Chat With React and Node

This project was created to learn more about Web Sockets and realtime applications using **Node** and **React**.

The main idea of the project is very simple: the user sign in with a name and a status, choose another user and start a conversation with him. Programming something like this is not as easy as may seem, but there are many tutorials out there to learn everything that is needed for this project.
